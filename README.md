# Claim Monitoring System

## Objective

This project is to develop a claim monitoring system that aggregates and analyzes user claims over time, providing valuable insights to the media team of FactCheck.

## System Overview

The trend monitoring system is designed to efficiently manage and analyze user claims through the following key steps:

1. **Aggregation of Claims**:
   - The system collects all user claims within a specified time window.

2. **Clustering into Topics**:
   - The aggregated claims are clustered into distinct topics using advanced clustering algorithms.

3. **Selection of Representative Claims**:
   - The system selects three representative claims that best exemplify the cluster for each topic cluster.

4. **Dashboard Display**:
   - Each topic cluster and its representative claims are displayed on a user-friendly dashboard.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Content Creation**: The media team can use the representative claims to bootstrap further writings, ensuring that content remains relevant and timely.
  
- **Efficient Monitoring**: The system offers a streamlined approach to monitoring and analyzing user claims, saving time and resources.

- **Data-Driven Insights**: The system provides valuable insights into user concerns and emerging trends by clustering claims into topics.
